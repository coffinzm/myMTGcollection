# myMTGcollection
A twitter bot that shares a random Magic card from my collection, twice a day

This Twitter bot is coded in Ruby and should run across platforms.


Collection Management and Card IDs:

I manage my collection using the wonderufl MTG Assistant. http://mtgbrowser.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

With this program, I am able to export a text file containing each card's unique Multiverse ID. 

It is not necessary to use MTG Assistant to make the program function, but you will at least need a list of Multiverse IDs.

Multiverse IDs are assigned by WoTC and can be found at the end of each card's Gatherer URL. For example: https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=9764
